# ENEM Data Analysis

The goal of this project is to analyze the ENEM 2019 edition microdata.

ENEM is a national High School exam annually applied by Brazil's federal government. It aims assessing the performance of the country's students relating to subjects ranging from text production to math problems resolution.

I've conceived five tasks to be carried out:

1) Plot a detailed chart representing how the candidates performed in both of the exam's days.

2) See if there is any correlation between the redaction grades and the illiteracy levels from Brazil's states.

3) Compare the ENEM performance among the private and public schools across the country.

4) Check if the students who live in states' capital cities outperform the ones who live in the rural area

5) Display the participants average performance accordingly to their economic class.

Note: I couldn't include in this repository the microdata and also the internal database created since they are too heavy to be added on Git. Nonetheless, you can encounter the csv document used in the project clicking <a href = 'https://www.gov.br/inep/pt-br/acesso-a-informacao/dados-abertos/microdados/enem'>here</a>.
